# Malice Network Python SDK Examples

This directory contains practical examples demonstrating how to use the Malice Network Python SDK.

## Prerequisites

1. **Running Malice Network server** - Ensure the server is running and accessible
2. **Valid authentication file** - Copy `client.auth` from your server to this directory
3. **Active sessions** - At least one implant should be connected to the server

## Examples

### `whoami.py` - Basic Command Execution

A minimal example that executes the `whoami` command on the first available session.

**Features:**
- Client connection and authentication
- Session discovery and selection
- Command execution with task management
- Result retrieval and display

**Usage:**
```bash
cd examples
cp /path/to/your/client.auth .
python whoami.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Connected to Malice Network server
📋 Found 1 active sessions
🎯 Using session: malefic (08d6c05a...)
🔍 Executing whoami command...
📋 Task created with ID: 42
⏳ Waiting for task completion...
🎯 Whoami result: Hunter
✅ Whoami command completed successfully!
```

## Common Patterns

### Error Handling

All examples include proper error handling for:
- Missing authentication files
- Connection failures
- No active sessions
- Command execution errors

### Authentication

Examples use `client.auth` files generated by the Malice Network server:
```python
client = MaliceClient.from_config_file("client.auth")
```

### Session Management

Sessions are discovered and accessed through the session manager:
```python
await client.update_sessions()
session = await client.sessions.get_session(session_id)
```

### Command Execution

Commands require module names and use the task-based execution model:
```python
task = await session.whoami(Request(name="whoami"))
task_context = await client.wait_task_finish(task)
result = task_context.spite.response.output
```

## Next Steps

After running these examples, explore the full SDK documentation and implement your own automation scripts for:
- File system operations
- Process management
- Registry operations
- Service management
- Custom module execution
